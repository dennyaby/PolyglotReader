# Ideas

1. Functionality to add place where user has finished reading (exact place on the page). So when user continues to read this mark is reset, or when user adds new mark old is erased. 
2. Think about folders (custom folders (user create what he wants) or auto filtering (by language for example)).
3. Some cool custom animation when opening and closing a book.
4. Give opportunity to select text direction (use book, toleft-toright, horizontal-vertical)
5. Give opportunity to copy text from image.
6. Work with accessibility
7. Different layout modes (infinite scroll or pagination, one or two pages)
8. Ability to add some widgets on the screen (like clever translator, notes widget) and configure all of it.
9. Add books names and authors to spotlight search on the phone.
10. Create custom plugin system? Everybody can create and propose his owns plugin, and users can browse plugins shop.
11. Add intergration with WaniKani


# Technical Questions

1. Should I implement reader through web view or natively?
